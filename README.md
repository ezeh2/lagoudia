lagoudia form engine
====================

Lagoudia is a javascript-library which supports dynamic form creation.

Following the advantages Lagoudia offers compared to classic web form creation:
* All fields, field types and field validations can be configured using a plain javascript-object. There is no need anymore to place input-elements manually as this is automatically done in Lagoudia.
* The same form can easily be integrated into an arbitray number of forms.
* Compatible with single page application


Following the advantages of lagoudia compared to templating-engines such as moustache or handlebar:
* No need anymore to define template-sections with cryptic and templating-engines specific syntax.
* As there is no templating-sections anymore, it is much easier to use the same form on several pages.
